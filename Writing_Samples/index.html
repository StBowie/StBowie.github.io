<h2>Write about the greatest day in the life of a turtle, from the turtle's perspective.</h2>
	<p>I patrolled my area of the castle, like I had for every day going back as far as I could remember. As always, the threat of invasion hung thick in the air, and dampened the moods of all around me.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I heard yelling coming from the castle entrance. In the distance, I could see a short man with a mustache and a red hat jumping to impossible heights and landing on the heads of my companions with brutal efficiency. Clearly, he had practiced his wretched craft elsewhere before coming here to disturb the precious tranquility of our castle. Even as I braced myself to meet my fate, I could not help but be thankful for the waiting to be over.</p>

<p>Finally, he landed before me, holding the grisly shell of one of my companions over his head. He smiled and then threw the shell at me. I could only watch as the deadly missile hurtled toward me. The impact of the shell on my torso stole the air from my lungs and left me in tremendous pain. But as I collapsed to the ground, the missile he had thrown rebounded from the wall behind me and struck him square in the face!</p>

<p>I smiled as I lay wounded on the castle floor and shouted for all to hear: ''MARIO HAS FALLEN! BOWSER AND THE PRINCESS WILL BE SAFE TOGETHER FOREVER!''</p>

<h2>Nameless Minion Defeats Red-Clothed Plumber</h2>
<p><em>Valiant effort by one of Bowser's turtle minions results in the defeat of a rampaging plumber</em></p>

<p>Press Release – Chicago, IL – September 2nd, 2013 – For weeks, the countryside has been ravaged by the work of a violent and criminal plumber, known to many as ''Mario.'' It seems that his reign of terror may finally be at an end, as Bowser & Co. are reporting his defeat at the hands of a nameless minion:</p>

<p>''Yes, we are pleased to report that the villain known as ‘Mario’ has been defeated. We can only hope that this will give some sense of closure to those who have lost loved ones.'' Bowser was speaking at the annual Mushroom and Turtle Minion Conference, and was greeted with great rounds of applause throughout his speech.</p>

<p>Bowser also took a moment to praise the particular worker that brought about this great accomplishment:</p>

<p>''We are very pleased with the work this turtle has done for us. This victory is the result of countless hours of persistence, and is a tribute to the work ethic he displays on a daily basis.''</p>

<p>Bowser encouraged anyone looking for employment to send their information to <a href="recruiting@bowser.com">recruiting@bowser.com</a>: ''We are always looking for new recruits. So many of them have moved on…. Castle patrol duty is often only the beginning for many of our young and talented workforce.''</p>
