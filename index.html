	<h1>Stephen Bowie</h1>
	I don't believe we've met yet. My name is Stephen, and I intend to convince you of my awesomeness. I understand you may be skeptical at first - know this leaves me undeterred.

<br>You should know that this picture is about a year old, and I have since added a pretty great scar under my right eyebrow. I've been told it adds to my already rugged demeanor.
<p>I graduated from the University of Michigan in May 2009 and promptly moved to Pittsburgh to begin a 3-year stint with Deloitte Consulting. While there, I made exactly three lifelong friendships and learned a great deal about how to successful in a high-stress environment. Ultimately, I decided to leave consulting because the travel was too much. I was leaving my city every Monday morning at 6am and returning late Thursday night and it made me miserable. The perks of consulting simply didn't outweigh the inability put down roots in the city I lived in.
	</p>
	<p>Since leaving Deloitte, I've worked for a start-up organization called Learn to Live, which provides online assistance for people with social anxiety. I have taken over all of their member engagement activities and have designed several studies to test and modify our approach to engaging members.

	<p>Work is obviously important, but I think what a person chooses to do in his or her personal time is just as essential to who that person is. With that in mind...

<h3>Write about the greatest day in the life of a turtle, from the turtle's perspective.</h3>
	<p>I patrolled my area of the castle, like I had for every day going back as far as I could remember. As always, the threat of invasion hung thick in the air, and dampened the moods of all around me.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I heard yelling coming from the castle entrance. In the distance, I could see a short man with a mustache and a red hat jumping to impossible heights and landing on the heads of my companions with brutal efficiency. Clearly, he had practiced his wretched craft elsewhere before coming here to disturb the precious tranquility of our castle. Even as I braced myself to meet my fate, I could not help but be thankful for the waiting to be over.</p>

<p>Finally, he landed before me, holding the grisly shell of one of my companions over his head. He smiled and then threw the shell at me. I could only watch as the deadly missile hurtled toward me. The impact of the shell on my torso stole the air from my lungs and left me in tremendous pain. But as I collapsed to the ground, the missile he had thrown rebounded from the wall behind me and struck him square in the face!</p>

<p>I smiled as I lay wounded on the castle floor and shouted for all to hear: ''MARIO HAS FALLEN! BOWSER AND THE PRINCESS WILL BE SAFE TOGETHER FOREVER!''
