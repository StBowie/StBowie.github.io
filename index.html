You should know that this picture is about a year old, and I have since added a pretty great scar under my right eyebrow. I've been told it adds to my already rugged demeanor.
<p>I graduated from the University of Michigan in May 2009 and promptly moved to Pittsburgh to begin a 3-year stint with Deloitte Consulting. While there, I made exactly three lifelong friendships and learned a great deal about how to be successful in a high-stress environment. Ultimately, I decided to leave consulting because the travel was too much. I was leaving my city every Monday morning at 6am and returning late Thursday night and it made me miserable. The perks of consulting simply didn't outweigh the inability to put down roots in the city I lived in.
	</p>
	<p>Since leaving Deloitte, I've worked for a start-up organization called <a href="http://learntolive.com" target="_blank">Learn to Live</a>, which provides online assistance for people with social anxiety. I have taken over all of their member engagement activities and have designed several studies to test and modify our approach to engaging members.
	</p>
	<p>Work is obviously important, but I think what a person chooses to do in his or her personal time is just as essential to who that person is. With that in mind...
