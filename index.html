<br>You should know that this picture is about a year old, and I have since added a pretty great scar under my right eyebrow. I've been told it adds to my already rugged demeanor.
<p>I graduated from the University of Michigan in May 2009 and promptly moved to Pittsburgh to begin a 3-year stint with Deloitte Consulting. While there, I made exactly three lifelong friendships and learned a great deal about how to successful in a high-stress environment. Ultimately, I decided to leave consulting because the travel was too much. I was leaving my city every Monday morning at 6am and returning late Thursday night and it made me miserable. The perks of consulting simply didn't outweigh the inability put down roots in the city I lived in.
