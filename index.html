	My name is Stephen and I am awesome. My mother says so.
	<br>This is my face:

<br>But this picture is a bit old and now I look much cooler. I have a scar.
<br>Also, Kelly is my girlfriend and is pretty cool. <h6>She has a great face too, even if it is less cool than mine because it does not have a sweet scar.</h6>
