	My name is Stephen and I am awesome. My mother says so.
	<br>This is my face:

<br>But this picture is a bit old and now I look much cooler. I have a scar.
<p>Reading and learning is one of my biggest joys in life. These are the books I've read recently:
<ul>
	<li>Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us</li>
	<li>Please Enroll Responsibly</li>
	<li>Basic Economics</li>
	<li>Scrum: A Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction</li>
</ul>
