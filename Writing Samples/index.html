<h2>Write about the greatest day in the life of a turtle, from the turtle's perspective.</h2>
	<p>I patrolled my area of the castle, like I had for every day going back as far as I could remember. As always, the threat of invasion hung thick in the air, and dampened the moods of all around me.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I heard yelling coming from the castle entrance. In the distance, I could see a short man with a mustache and a red hat jumping to impossible heights and landing on the heads of my companions with brutal efficiency. Clearly, he had practiced his wretched craft elsewhere before coming here to disturb the precious tranquility of our castle. Even as I braced myself to meet my fate, I could not help but be thankful for the waiting to be over.</p>

<p>Finally, he landed before me, holding the grisly shell of one of my companions over his head. He smiled and then threw the shell at me. I could only watch as the deadly missile hurtled toward me. The impact of the shell on my torso stole the air from my lungs and left me in tremendous pain. But as I collapsed to the ground, the missile he had thrown rebounded from the wall behind me and struck him square in the face!</p>

<p>I smiled as I lay wounded on the castle floor and shouted for all to hear: ''MARIO HAS FALLEN! BOWSER AND THE PRINCESS WILL BE SAFE TOGETHER FOREVER!''</p>
